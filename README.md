Our project delves into the realm of machine learning and computer vision to 
address the prevalent issue of night-time accidents among two-wheeler riders. 
Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a cornerstone in image detection 
tasks, we have developed an advanced object detection system. This system employs 
state-of-the-art technology to swiftly identify obstacles like sand piles, pits, and rocks 
in real-time, enhancing riders' safety during low-visibility conditions. Through 
intuitive user interfaces, including text message displays and voice commands, 
accessibility and usability are prioritized
